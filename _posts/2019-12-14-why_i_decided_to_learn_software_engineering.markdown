Most people who know me know that I am a polyglot and I am very interested in human languages. What most people don't know is that I don't learn human languages in order to communicate with humans; I learn them because I enjoy the learning process of recognizing patterns, creating my own functional sentences, being able to understand things that other people may not and so on.  

I don't remember exactly how it happened but about a year ago, I realized it would make sense to try learning computer languages as they are essentially all grammar and I can create things with them. I didn't really know where to start so I pretty much just dove in. I took some free online courses and did some tutorials. I have learned a lot since then but I still don't feel as confident as I would like to. I think part of the reason is because of the lack of structure and community I have had along the self-study route. With human languages, I have always taken the self-study route but I have also always been very involved in the polyglot space of the internet. Motivation has never been much of a problem for me, it's more about just having a community that I can relate to. That's when I decided I should take an official course and that is what has brought me to Flatiron School.

I chose Flatiron because during the time I was taking free tutorials online, I took the free Bootcamp prep course and I really liked layout and features of Flatiron's platform. Some personal preferences also played a part in my decision to choose Flatiron but they are not major things. 

Present day, I consider my coding skills to be very "patchy" in the sense that I really get some things and other things, I am really lost. One thing that I feel like I really need to work on is iteration. I'm not sure what it is that I don't get but I know if I stick with it, everything will fall into place.
