Over the 2 weeks break we had here at Flatiron, I went ahead and continued with the curriculum. That took me into Object Oriented Ruby.  It hasn't been easy but having some previous knowledge in other computer languages and having done a few projects in the past has helped quite a bit. 

Using Object Oriented Ruby is a way to be more organized by using classes. I can see how it can very helpful however, I still get lost sometimes going back and forth from file to file to make sure they all "know" each other.  It is definitely something that I will get used to with time. By doing projects, I know I will get much better and faster. As with anything, the beginning can always be rough and you just have to stick with it.

On another note, I am much better with iteration now. Yay!
